the required vendor libraries:

RedKite CMS setup
-----------------
RedKite CMS requires several steps to be accomplished to properly setup the CMS itself. Luckily
the **RedKiteCmsInstallerBundle** will do all the job for you. 

This bundle provides a web installer interface or an interactive symdony2 command to install 
RedKite CMS.

Installing from the console
---------------------------
Installing RedKite CMS from the console is really easy:

    app/console redkitecms:install

This will run the interactive command. Simply provide the required information and you are done! 

When the setup ends, point your browser at

    http://localhost/rkcms.php/backend/login

to start using RedKite CMS.


Installing using the web interface
----------------------------------
To install RedKite CMS using the web interface, just point your browser at:

    http://localhost/app_dev.php/install

Provide the required information and you are done! 


Sign in
-------
RedKite CMS is secured by default and a new user is created when the application is 
installed:

    username: admin
    password: admin

enter the credentials above to sign in.

Notes for windows users
-----------------------
RedKite CMS has been written on a linux system machine, so you might encounter some small issues when
you work on a windows machine:

- assetic:dump command might return an error
- Skin problems

None of those problems breaks the usability of RedKite CMS. If you are a windows user and you want
to fix them on your own, fork the repository, do the fixes then ask for a pull request: it would be really
appreciated! :)

Enjoy!
